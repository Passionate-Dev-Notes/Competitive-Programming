Given an array arr of size n which contains elements in range from 0 to n-1, you need to find all the elements occurring more than once in the given array. Return the answer in ascending order. If no such element is found, return list containing [-1]. 

Examples:

Input: n = 4, arr[] = [0,3,1,2]
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no repeating element in the array. Therefore output is -1.
Input: n = 5, arr[] = [2,3,1,2,3]
Output: 2 3 
Explanation: 2 and 3 occur more than once in the given array.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n).

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 105
0 <= arr[i] <= 105, for each valid i
